* :inbox_tray: **Continuous Integration/Deployment** Modular [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to lint, build, test, and deploy to DigitalOcean cloud
* :leftwards_arrow_with_hook: **pre-commit** [Git hooks](https://pre-commit.com/) to maintain code quality using modern tooling (ruff, black, isort)

## Input Variables
The generator (cookiecutter) will ask you for some data, you might want to have at hand before generating the project.

The input variables, with their default values (some auto generated) are:

* `project_name`: The name of the project
* `project_slug`: The development friendly name of the project. By default, based on the project name
* `project_slug_db`: The database friendly name of the project. By default, based on the project name
* `author_email`: The authors email...used for certbot
* `py_version`: The version of Python to install. Options are `3.9`, `3.10`, and `3.11`
* `db_container_name`: The name of the database container. Default `db`

* `github_username`: The username of the GitHub user. Used for badge display in generated project `README.md`
* `deployments`: Include `docker-compose` files needed for deployment step in GitHub Action. Options are `y` or `n`


## More Details
After using this generator, your new project (the directory created) will contain an extensive `README.md` with instructions for development, deployment, etc. You can view it [here](/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_slug%20%7D%7D/README.md)

## Development
This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#osx--linux--bashonwindows-install-instructions) to manage dev environment.  Once installed:
1. install packages with `poetry install`
2. run tests with `poetry run pytest tests`

Pre-commit:
1. Install pre-commit hooks with `pre-commit install`
2. Run hooks with `pre-commit run --all-files`
